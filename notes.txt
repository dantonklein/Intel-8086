8086 Microprocessor Notes:

CISC Architecture!
20-bit address bus (Up tp 1MB memory), 16-bit data bus
Segmented memory architecture, addressed using both a segment register and an offset.
Segment register points to the start of a segment, offset specifies location of a byte in the segment.

Two execution units: Execution Unit(EU) and the bus interface unit (BIU)
Execution Unit: Executes instructions
Bus Interface Unit: Fetches instructions and decodes them. Manages data transfer between processor and memory/ I/O

Registers: General-Purpose, segment, special
General-Purpose: Stores data, performs arithmetic and logic operations
Segment: Addresses memory segments
Special: Flags (Status info from previous operation), Intruction Pointer

14 internal Registers
8086 is pipelined!

Memory Segmentation:
Addresses 1MB of memory by segmenting it into 16 64kB segments (16bit), only 4 segment registers at a time

Bus Interface Unit:
Generates the 20bit physical address
Fetches instructions from memory
Transfer data to/from memory/ I/O
Maintains the 6-byte pre-fetch instruction queue (pipelining stuff)

Contains 4 Segment Registers, Instruction Pointer, pre-fetch queue, and Address Generation Circuit

20bit Address = Segment Address x 0x10 + Offset(IP)

Instruction Pointer(IP):
16-bit register that holds the offset of the next instructions in the Code Segment
Gets incremented after every instruction byte is fetched, gets a new value when a branch occurs

Code Segment Register(CS): 16-bit register that holds the base address for the Code segment

Data Segment Register(DS): 16-bit register that holds the base address for the Data Segment

Stack Segment Register(SS): 16-bit register that holds the base address for the Stack Segment

Extra Segment Register(ES): 16-bit register that holds the base address for the extra segment
